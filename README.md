# Display Refresh Rate Changer
Changing the display refresh rate when the laptop charger is disconnected (Currently the Changer.exe file only changes between 60Hz and 165Hz)


I included a task scheduler xml to import, as of right now it wants the Changer.exe to be in following path "C:\Refresh Rate Change\Changer.exe"

To change the path, change the following ``<Command>"C:\Refresh Rate Change\Changer.exe"</Command>``

The Changer.exe file is made from the python code, might trigger the windows antivirus, you can choose to use the one i gave or compile your own using either auto-py-to-exe or pyinstaller using a command like the following ``pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon "Path/to/folder/change.ico"  "Path/to/folder/Changer.py"``

I'll work on making it so you choose the refresh rates to change between and not having to import the task scheduler xml file.
